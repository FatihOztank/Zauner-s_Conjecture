# Zauner-s_Conjecture
Part of my school's summer project i did during the pandemic times.
Project was about generalising generating sic-povm's for dimensions
greater than 3. The matlab code gives us an estimate for those sic-povm's in higher
dimensions.
Each row of the matrix represents a different vector.

grSc is the method to arrange the angle between two linearly indep. vectors

real_sic_povm uses grSc method to produce equiangular lines in n dim. 
real space.

Use test method to get a matrix of inner products between all vector pairs.
